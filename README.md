PrintableVacuumPump
===================

Description

Water jet vacuum pump (Aspirator / Bunsen pump / Venturi pump). 

In its current state, it will happily implode an empty soda bottle, but the theoretical limit for such a pump is the vapour pressure of water.

Instructions

1) Slice & print pump.stl using 100% infill for maximum strength

2) Sand and glue the pieces together using acetone. Paint the seams with acetone/ABS.

The design is for a vacuum hose with an outer diameter of 9 m.m. and a water hose with an inner diameter of 13 m.m. The design can easily be modified to accomodate other dimensions.

Insert the vacuum hose (a semi-rigid thick walled PVC tube will do), and connect a standard garden hose using a small hose clamp.
